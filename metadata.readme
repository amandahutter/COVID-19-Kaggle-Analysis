(1) Metadata for papers from these sources are combined: CZI, PMC, BioRxiv/MedRxiv. (total records 29500)
	- CZI 1236 records
	- PMC 27337
	- bioRxiv 566
	- medRxiv 361
(2) 17K of the paper records have PDFs and the hash of the PDFs are in 'sha'
(3) For PMC sourced papers, one paper's metadata can be associated with one or more PDFs/shas under that paper - a PDF/sha correponding to the main article, and possibly additional PDF/shas corresponding to supporting materials for the article.
(4)	13K of the PDFs were processed with fulltext ('has_full_text'=True)
(5) Various 'keys' are populated with the metadata:
	- 'pmcid': populated for all PMC paper records (27337 non null)
	- 'doi': populated for all BioRxiv/MedRxiv paper records and most of the other records (26357 non null)
	- 'WHO #Covidence': populated for all CZI records and none of the other records (1236 non null)
	- 'pubmed_id': populated for some of the records
	- 'Microsoft Academic Paper ID': populated for some of the records

* added column "url" (URL to paper landing page where available)
* normalized publication date, dois
* adjusted deduplication logic slightly (affects 3 papers)
* removed some entries that correspond to indices or table of contents

2020-04-03
---CHANGES---
* added PMC XML parses; available under metadata file column "has_pmc_xml_parse"
* renamed "has_full_text" metadata column to "has_pdf_parse"
* restructured tar.gz outputs, example new directory structure:
|-- comm_use_subset
   |-- pmc_json (contains all JSON derived from PMC XML parses; filenames are PMC_ID.xml.json)
   |-- pdf_json (contains all JSON derived from PDF parses)

NOTE: some papers have both PMC XML and PDF parses
